# Refresh quantitative metrics + fight profiles

Fetch live numbers and merge via `node src/apply-metrics.mjs <file>` (input shape:
`{ "metrics": [...], "profiles": [...] }` — see the header comment in that script).
Numbers stay numbers — **never convert metrics to letter tiers.**

## WCL API (preferred when configured)

Credentials come from either source, checked in this order:
1. **Environment variables** `WCL_CLIENT_ID` + `WCL_CLIENT_SECRET` — used by the **cloud
   routine** (set as routine environment secrets; the local config.json is gitignored and
   absent in the cloud). This is the required path when running server-side: WCL asks
   scrapers to "use the API instead," and datacenter IPs are more likely to be throttled
   on the HTML endpoint, so authenticate as the registered client instead of scraping.
2. **`.claude/skills/refresh-metrics/config.json`** (see `config.json.example`) — the
   local path, same two fields (`clientId`, `clientSecret`).

If either is present, use the sanctioned v2 GraphQL API instead of HTML scraping: POST
client-credentials to `https://www.warcraftlogs.com/oauth/token`, then query
`https://www.warcraftlogs.com/api/v2/client` (zone rankings/statistics by encounter,
difficulty, metric). If NEITHER is present, use the HTML fallback below and remind the
user ONCE per session that registering a free client at warcraftlogs.com/api/clients/
makes this sanctioned and more reliable.
Never commit config.json or echo the secret (env or file) into logs, commits, or reports.

## Sources & recipes

- **Warcraft Logs** (live S1: raid zone 46, M+ zone 47): statistics-table endpoint
  documented in CLAUDE.md → "Metrics" workflow. Needs `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest`
  + browser UA + Referer headers; response is an HTML fragment with UNCLOSED `<td>` tags
  — parse with regex, not a strict parser. Metric names in use:
  "Median rDPS (Mythic, all bosses)" / "Median HPS (…)" / "…(M+, all dungeons)".
- **Archon numbers** (same `__NEXT_DATA__` JSON as tiers): "95th pct DPS (Mythic)",
  "M+ score (95th pct)", "Popularity" (fraction × 100, unit "%").
- **Murlok** meta pages (plain GET; **r.jina.ai does NOT work on murlok**):
  "Top-50 avg M+ rating (ceiling)" — it is the avg rating of each spec's own top-50
  players, NOT popularity; keep the "(ceiling)" in the name.
- **Mythicstats** (mythicstats.com): per-spec representation % in the top 2000 keys per
  weekly period — metric name "Top-2000 keys representation", unit "%". JS-heavy; fetch
  via r.jina.ai. Note the period id in the refresh log.
- **Bloodmallet** (fight profiles, DPS specs only):
  `GET bloodmallet.com/chart/get/talent_target_scaling/castingpatchwerk/{class}/{spec}`
  — take BEST build DPS per target count (1/2/3/5/8/15) into `profiles[].targets`.

## Gotchas

- Bloodmallet class names are **snake_case** (`demon_hunter`, `beast_mastery`); the
  `targets` chart type and `hecticaddcleave` fight style return errors — use
  `talent_target_scaling`. Confirm `simc_settings.tier == "MID1"` on every chart.
- **WCL fetching**: pull each cut fresh every run — no at-most-daily cap (policy
  2026-07-08: pull everything every run). The server replies "Use the API … instead of
  scraping HTML" without the XHR header, so always send the XHR header + browser UA +
  Referer. The sanctioned path is a free v2 GraphQL client (warcraftlogs.com/api/v2/client)
  — the runner uses it (datacenter IPs get Cloudflare-blocked on the HTML endpoint); the
  HTML endpoint works from a residential IP for local runs.
- **WCL v2 API status (2026-07-14, probe-verified — read before re-deriving ANY of it):**
  - **Transport is SOLVED from datacenter runners.** Recipe: browser `User-Agent` on the
    `POST /oauth/token` call; `Origin: https://www.warcraftlogs.com` +
    `Referer: https://www.warcraftlogs.com/` + a `sec-ch-ua` header on the
    `/api/v2/client` POST. Without these, Cloudflare silently empty-bodies the token
    call and 403-challenges the GraphQL call. Reference implementation: `src/wcl-probe.mjs`.
  - **The blocker is WCL-side, not ours:** `characterRankings` throws a bare
    "Internal server error" for the entire redistributed-credit metric family
    (`rdps`/`ndps`/`cdps`/`bossrdps`) on EVERY encounter — live zone 46 and PTR zone 52
    alike — while `dps`/`hps`/`wdps`/`default` work. Bisected argument-by-argument
    (className/specName/difficulty/partition all fine) and reproduced deterministically.
  - **`metric: default` is NOT a workaround:** probe-verified byte-identical to plain
    `dps` (joined by character name, 0.00% delta on live and dummy encounters). Do not
    substitute `dps`-family numbers under the rDPS-labeled series (honest source
    typing), and do not rebuild statistics-table medians from rankings pages — the
    leaderboard is a paginated top-parses list (`count` is page-local), not the parse
    population, and zone 54's cross-boss normalized score has no API analogue at all.
  - **Standing behavior until WCL fixes it:** ONE cheap retry per run (a single
    `metric: rdps` query on a known-good encounter, e.g. 3176); if still 500, record
    the five WCL manifest rows as `unreachable` with this reason and leave data
    unchanged. The dispatch-only workflow **"WCL API probe (diagnostic)"**
    (`.github/workflows/wcl-probe.yml`) re-checks the whole picture in ~20s. If rdps
    starts working: zone 52 (single encounter per target count, small population) is
    the first candidate for an API-median recipe — validate full-population coverage
    by paginating to the end and comparing counts before trusting any median.
- **Zone 54 is the 12.1 PTR raid** (Venomous Abyss), zone 56 M+ S2 PTR — PTR-quality
  data. **Zone 52 is "Dummy Dome"** — a target-dummy sim harness (Sinister Single 1T /
  Diabolical Duo 2T / Terrible Trio 3T / Fearsome Five 5T / Hazardous Healer), NOT a raid;
  it's real-player fixed-target-count DPS/HPS (a logged analogue of Bloodmallet's target
  scaling). Don't confuse 52 with 54. (52 now feeds `spec.ptrDummy` — refreshed by
  ptr-watch step 6; boss ids 3591=1T / 3590=2T / 3592=3T / 3593=5T, `aggregate=amount`
  → median rDPS. Merge via `apply-metrics.mjs` `ptrdummy` key.)
- **PTR data stays labeled**: metric names carry "(12.1 PTR …)" AND rows carry
  `era: "ptr"` (apply-metrics preserves it; validation enforces name↔era agreement).
  Keep PTR series out of live baselines.
- Live raid zone 46: Mythic requires `size=20`; `difficulty=4` is HEROIC, Mythic is 5.
- Fight-profile labels are computed at build time (within-role percentiles) — you only
  supply raw `targets`; don't hand-write labels.
- Healers/tanks get no Bloodmallet profiles (DPS sims only) — that's by design.

After merging: `npm test && npm run build`, then `node src/snapshot.mjs` (movement
baseline; loadData skips baselines identical to the current state, so ordering vs the
build is safe); append date + row counts to `.claude/skills/refresh-metrics/log.md`.
